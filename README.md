# Hyperdrive - A Hypermedia Specification

### Current Version 0.1

Any input is appreciated. You can file an issue, make a pull request or reach out on Twitter

## Introduction

Hyperdrive is a hypermedia specification for representing entities.
Hyperdrive is intended to be generic specification that extends existing JSON hypermedia specifications,
making them even more awesome, kind of like painting flames on a space ship. Hyperdrive adds a detailed
quote to each entity based on the HTTP Status Code that accurately describes the status. The existing
HTTP specification does an okay job describing status codes, but with Hyperdrive quotes, the process is
much more streamlined and awesome.

## Rules

  * A Hyperdrive response MUST be valid JSON
  * If Hyperdrive response sends a body, the body MUST have a key called hyperquote whose contents SHOULD be the Quote from the table below based on the HTTP Status Code. Other quotes can be substituted if needed.
  * A Hyperdrive response SHOULD use the media type application/vnd.hyperdrive+json

## Example

On a GET request to /prisoners when you are not authorized, you might get the following HAL response:

```
    {
       "hyperquote": "Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?"
       "_links": {
            "self": { "href": "/prisoners" },
       }
    }
```

When trying to POST to /locations/mos-eisley-cantina and you use a wrong media type:

```
    {
       "hyperquote": "Hey! We don't serve their kind here.",
       "_links": {
            "self": { "href": "/locations/mos-eisley-cantina" },
       }
    }
```

When requesting an accept for processing, but the processing isn't wrapped up yet, you can send a 202 like this:

```
    {
        "hyperquote": "I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.",
        "foo": "bar",
        "_links": {
            "self": { "href": "/foo" }
        }
    }
```
